This is a readme file for Programming Project 1

The code for both sender and requester is done wiht required functionalities. I am also printing the required information specified in the project description after every packet.
Sender : Add to traverse through the file and store the message in an array.
For Requester: Need to add tracker file and edit code such that requester traverses through this file and reuqests file parts in the order of ID's.

Final thing is change the implementaiton such that it take arguments. I can work on this...
